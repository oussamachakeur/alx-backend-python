# Python Generators - Project 0x00

This project demonstrates advanced usage of **Python generators** to process large datasets efficiently, integrate with SQL databases, and simulate real-world streaming scenarios.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- ✅ Master Python generators using the `yield` keyword for memory-efficient data processing.
- ✅ Implement batch processing and lazy loading for large datasets.
- ✅ Simulate real-world scenarios such as live data updates.
- ✅ Optimize performance when computing aggregate functions on large datasets.
- ✅ Integrate Python with SQL databases (MySQL/SQLite) using dynamic queries.
